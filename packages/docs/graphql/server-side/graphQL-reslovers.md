In order an API to return data, the resolver is is a function that's responsible for populating the data for a single field in your schema. 

The resolver map is just a big object that holds all of those type, field, resolver functions. Resolvers can return objects or scalars like strings, numbers, Booleans, et cetera. They can also resolve values from another REST API, database, cache, or any other source.
