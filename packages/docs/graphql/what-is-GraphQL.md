GraphQL is a query language. It is an alternative to REST APIs as a form of querying back-end data.


It is a schema-based method that is agnostic to the data source or the front-end frame work. The advantages of this method of querying data is that you can pick and choose the exact data you need in the front end to use in the display. The REST HTTP method needs 4 query's one for each method - Create-Read-Update-Delete. GraphQl you need only 1 request. Making it more efficient.

The schema picks up data from different points of the graph isolating the data in a way that is easier to consume.
